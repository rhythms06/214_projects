Workload E:

We created a linked list of 20 nodes, populated each node with random integer

We wanted to do this workload because it was different then the ones assigned,
and we wanted to actually use the data that we were allocating. 


Workload F:

It's 11:48 as I write this. 
Not gonna happen. :(
