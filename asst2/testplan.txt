Our general plan is to try multiprocessing and then try multithreading with increasing list sizes.

Our first size is 250. We start searching with one process and one thread, and then increment the number of processes and threads, until for each we start to find diminishing returns in speed. Each test, we record the min, max, avg, and stdev of five trials.

After that, we try the same with a size of 300. The main purpose of this test is to ensure that our code works with list sizes not divisible by 250.

Then we try sizes in the power of 2, starting with 500 and ending with 32000.
