The server should maintain a list of messages sent to it by clients.
This can be implemented with a linked list, where each node looks a bit like:

  struct box {
    struct queue* head;
    struct queue* q;
    pthread_mutex_t lock;
    char* name;
    int in_use;
    struct box* next;
  }

We can use a global mutex lock to avoid sync issues with the overall linked list.

We don't need to keep track of previous messages.

My TA recommends using IPv4 and TCP, but we can use any protocols we want, as long as they work on the iLabs.
